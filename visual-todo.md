### ðŸ”´ Priority Issues

- [x] **Issue #1: Droplets falling outside text bounds**
  - Problem: Droplets spawn and fall outside text area (yolo offsets)

  - Status: âœ… Complete
  - Changes: 
    - Use `titleText.getBounds()` to get actual text dimensions
    - Calculate minX/maxX based on text bounds with 5% margin
    - Changed from percentage-based to absolute pixel positioning
  - Commit: `fix: constrain droplets to text bounds`
  - Ready for review

- [ ] **Issue #2: Droplet physics not responsive to text position**
  - Problem: Slow-down/acceleration hardcoded, not responsive
  - Solution: Get red text top/bottom Y coordinates from PixiJS, use for physics calculation
  - Status: Not started
  - Commit: `fix: make droplet physics responsive to text position`

- [ ] **Issue #3: Gray background appears after PixiJS load**
  - Problem: Background should be all black, gray appears after PixiJS renders
